Hey yall, this is where I'll post progress on the project! I added a lot of notes in the code so hopefully it's easier to follow.

!!IMPORTANT!!

In order for the Main File.py to work, you have to create a directory in pycharm called Images. Put the pictures from the Images folder on GitHub into your images directory and it should work. Do the same thing with the Sounds and Music folder.

You can create a directory by right-clicking on the highest folder in the bar on the left (it'll have the name of the project your on). Hover over "new" and click "directory". After naming it, it should appear on the bar on the left. Then download all the image and sound files from GitHub and drag them from File Explorer over to the right directories.
