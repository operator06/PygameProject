Hey yall, this is where I'll post progress on the project! 
(Don't mind the random images I used it was just what I already had downloaded)

!!IMPORTANT!!
In order for the Main File.py to work, you have to create a directory in pycharm called Images. Put the pictures from the Images folder on GitHub into your images directory and it should work.
